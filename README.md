# go-alexa-api
This is a collection of alexa skills for my home.  I constructed them in golang mainly to learn the language better.
Please feel free to use it however you like.  It bases itself on the [go-alexa project](https://github.com/mikeflynn/go-alexa/tree/master/skillserver), so in order to use it you will have to go get that project.  It also is very tied to my own personal setup so likely you will have to fork it and make your own modifications if you want to use it.
